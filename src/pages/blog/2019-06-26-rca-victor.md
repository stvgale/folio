<span>Using Raspberry Pi, Hifi Berry, Arduino and custom speakers I am in the process of restoring this classic RCA Victor cabinet. Raspberry Pi is the main computer running a custom modified version of Linux to power 7,000 live radio stations world-wide, bluetooth and Spotify over my home wifi network. Arduino was used to add key binding to the operating system using radial encoders in the original knob positions.</span>
